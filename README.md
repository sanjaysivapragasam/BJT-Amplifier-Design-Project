# BJT-Amplifier-Design-Project

I successfully designed and simulated a 3-stage (CE-CE-CC) inverting BJT amplifier using Multisim, achieving a 100% project score by meeting all design specifications, including a +10 V power supply constraint to maintain a maximum of 10 mA quiescent current. This was achieved by effectively utilizing AC and DC analysis to ensure accurate simulations and calculations of the common emitter and common collector circuits that allowed a maximum loaded voltage of 4 V, and no-load voltage gain of 50 to be achieved. The detailed design report and all manual calculations that provide clear documentation of all key benchmarks and simulations can be found in this repository. Below is the final schematic of the amplifier created:
